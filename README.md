# Data-Integration-Final-Project
This is the Final project for Data Integration 

The short-term rental market is a trend that has been of a big boom over the past decade. And one of the first few biggest companies that caught up to that trend and mastered it is AirBnB which is indeed most famous for their extravagant selection of short-term rental properties. 
There is a pressing need for advanced analytical techniques that can ultimately precisely pinpoint lucrative opportunities as traditional real estate dynamics and the distinctive revenue potential of vacation rentals collide. In this report we will be discussing how we can resolve such issues by using Databricks along with pyspark sql, for conduction comprehensive analysis of Airbnb market performance compared to the local real estate properties using the sales data.
